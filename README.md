## Color Balance and Fusion for Underwater Image Enhancement
# Abstract
We have presented an alternative approach to enhance underwater videos and images. Our strategy builds on the fusion principle and does not require additional information than the single original image. We have shown in our experiments that our approach is able to enhance a wide range of underwater images (e.g. different cameras, depths, light conditions) with high accuracy, being able to recover important faded features and edges. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrate the utility and relevance of the proposed image enhancement technique for several challenging underwater computer vision applications.
